# -Smart-Home-Automation-System-with-IoT-and-Voice-Control
Abstract:
This project presents the design and implementation of an IoT-based smart home automation system that allows users to control various home appliances and monitor environmental conditions remotely. Leveraging the power of the Internet of Things (IoT), the system integrates a central microcontroller (e.g., ESP32 or Raspberry Pi) with multiple sensors (temperature, humidity, light, motion) and actuators (relays for appliances, LEDs). Users can manage their home environment through a user-friendly mobile application or a web interface, and for enhanced convenience, voice commands via a popular voice assistant (e.g., Google Assistant, Amazon Alexa) are incorporated. The system aims to provide a cost-effective, scalable, and energy-efficient solution for modern smart homes, enhancing comfort, security, and energy management. Real-time data from sensors is published to a cloud platform, enabling historical data analysis and trigger-based automation rules.
